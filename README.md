# mstruct-fit-instrument-with-matlab

### Requirements:

- measured data in 'xy' format
- table with positions and intensities of diffraction lines (generated e.g. by PDF2)

#### note:
- adjustments to other data formats is straightforward
- the hkl table can be generated by any software, a screenshot below shows export in Pearson's crystal data

## Outline

The workflow to receive the instrumental function parameters for MStruct is

1. semi-automatically fit pattern segments in Matlab
2. import fitting result into an Excel worksheet
3. review the instrument polynomial approximation in Excel
